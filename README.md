stencils for mozfest 2016


For the 2016 MozFest, I am making stencils and other tools printmaking. During the event, we'll have an area where people can use these to print their own shirts, signs and other things.


## What is this github repo?

 * `stencils` - a folder where for completed stencil designs that are ready to be laser-cut. They'll all be SVG files
 * `fodder` - a folder for any images or pieces of designs that are not complete but could be use as inspiration or for parts of a stencil. these files could be PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF or other image files

## Contribute

Do you want to see a stencil at MozFest? You can submit it here. I can't guarantee that I'll laser cut it but if it's good and easy to work with, I'll do it!

### Submit a completed stencil design

If you have stencil design ready to go, you can add it to the `stencils` directory and create a pull request. I'll review it and if I can make it for MozFest, I will!

### Submit a non-stenciled file 

If you have a sketch of an idea or a logo or a design that you want made into a stencil, you can add it to the `fodder` folder. No promises, but maybe I'll convert to a laser stencil design and cut some for MozFest. You can also just submit visual ideas to `fodder`. Make a pull request and include any attribution on the designs.

### Share an idea

Not artistic but have a good idea for a stencil? You can create [a new issue](https://github.com/drewrwilson/mozfest-stencils/issues/new) on this github project and I'll have a look!
