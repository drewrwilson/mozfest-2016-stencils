# mozfest-stencils

This is a collection of laser cuttable stencils that will be available at [MozFest 2016](https://mozillafestival.org/).

On October 28-30 at MozFest in London, I'm hosting a station called "Making Change: DIY Activist Art". We'll be print shirts, patches, tote bags, posters, making buttons and other activisty art. This github project is where I'm storing the files that I'm using to make the stencils and designs.

## What is this github project?

By storing designs here I'm intending to allow a way for others to participate in creating these designs. Jump below if you have a design that you'd like laser cut for MozFest 2016.

Here's how this project is works:

 * `stencils` - a folder for completed stencil designs that are ready to be laser-cut. They'll all be SVG files. Each SVG must have a very thin stroke (1pt or smaller). Fill color does not matter.
 * `fodder` - a folder for any images or pieces of designs that are not complete but could be used as inspiration or for parts of a stencil. It's best if they're SVGs, but it's fine if these files could be PNG, JPG, PDF or other image files.

## How to Contribute

Do you want to see a stencil at MozFest? You can submit it here. I can't guarantee that I'll laser cut it but if it's good and easy to work with, I'll do it. We may also have access to a laser cutter during MozFest so you may be able to submit them during the festival too.

### Submit a completed stencil design

If you have stencil design ready to go, you can add it to the `stencils` directory and create a pull request. Add any notes about it that you think are relevant. I'll review it and if I can make it for MozFest, I will!

### Submit a non-stenciled file

If you have a sketch of an idea or a logo or a design that you want made into a stencil, you can add it to the `fodder` folder. No promises, but maybe I'll convert to a laser stencil design and cut some for MozFest. You can also just submit visual ideas to `fodder`. Make a pull request and include any attribution on the designs.

### Share an idea

Are you not very artistic but have a good idea for a stencil? You could create [a new issue](https://github.com/drewrwilson/mozfest-stencils/issues/new) on this github project and I'll read it


## Other related projects

You might also be interested in [Stencil Validator](https://drewrwilson.com/stencilvalidator/) (here's the [code on github](https://github.com/drewrwilson/stencilvalidator))--it's a web tool to check if a given design is a valid stencil that could be produced with a laser cutter. If you're a javascript wizard who knows how to work with SVGs, you could be a huge help on that project.
