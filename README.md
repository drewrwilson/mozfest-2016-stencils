# mozfest-stencils
stencils for mozfest 2016


For the 2016 MozFest, I am making stencils and other tools printmaking. During the event, we'll have an area where people can use these to print their own shirts, signs and other things.


What is this github repo?

 * `stencils` - a folder where for completed stencil designs that are ready to be laser-cut. They'll all be SVG files
 * `fodder` - a folder for any images or pieces of designs that are not complete but could be use as inspiration or for parts of a stencil. these files could be PNG, JPG, SVG, PDF or other image files
